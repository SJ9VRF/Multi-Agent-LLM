### `notebooks/`
The `notebooks` directory is intended for Jupyter notebooks that you use for demonstrations, experiments, or detailed analyses that support your project. This is particularly useful for visualization, interactive exploration of data, and step-by-step tutorials.

#### Example Notebooks
- **QuickStart.ipynb**: A notebook that demonstrates how to quickly set up and run the agents.
- **DataExploration.ipynb**: Provides an in-depth look at the data, showcasing document statistics, common queries, and the performance of different document agents.
- **AgentDemo.ipynb**: Showcases detailed examples of queries handled by the document-specific and top-level agents, illustrating the systemâ€™s capabilities and how to interact with it.

### Including Notebooks in `README.md`
Mention these notebooks in your `README.md` to guide new users on how to interact with your project effectively:
